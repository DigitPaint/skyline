= Mootools On Rails

== WARNING
This is a heavily modified version of Mootools on rails!! It only works with Skyline.

== How to install

Just follow these three steps :

1. You must run the following task : 
	rake mootools_on_rails:install

2. You must add the following line in your layout :
	<%= javascript_include_tag :mootools %>

3. You must add the following line in your RAILS_ROOT/config/routes.rb
	ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
	 ...
	  MootoolsOnRails.routes
	  ...
	end
	
That's all !


== How to use

=== Event behaviour

In your view :

  <% add_event('link', 'click') do |page|
  	page.alert('coucou div 2')
   end %>
  
  <%= content_tag(:a, "My Link", :id => 'link') %>
